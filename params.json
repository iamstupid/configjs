{"name":"Configjs","tagline":"Function argument checker","body":"#configjs\r\n>configjs is a powerful tool to make overload functions   \r\nEveryone knows `JavaScript` doesn't allow function overload, so the traditional way to avoid it is to use `JavaScript arguments` or check argument type. It is unscientific and it makes the code hard to read and understand (just think about you are reading a open source library with `if(typeof)`s everywhere and function redirects(a famous example is **jQuery**))   \r\n```javascript\r\n//a piece of bad code\r\nfunction help(){\r\n  if(arguments.length===0){\r\n    print_help_message();\r\n  }\r\n  var k=arguments[0];\r\n  if(typeof k===\"object\"){\r\n    if(typeof k.help===\"undefined\"){\r\n      print(helpMap(k));\r\n    }else{\r\n      print(k.help);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  if(typeof k===\"function\"){\r\n    print(helpFunctionMap(k));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe code is unreadable!    \r\n>Why I should write like this?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
